Type Safety:
any: No type safety; you can perform any operation without type checking.
unknown: Provides type safety; requires type checking before performing operations.

Assignability:
any: Can be assigned to any type and can have any type assigned to it.
unknown: Can be assigned to any type, but you cannot assign it directly to a specific type without type checking or a type assertion.

Operations:
any: Allows calling methods, accessing properties, and performing operations without any checks.
unknown: Does not allow calling methods, accessing properties, or performing operations without type checking or a type assertion.

Type Inference:
any: Disables TypeScript's type inference, making the type system less effective.
unknown: Retains TypeScript's type inference, helping to catch errors at compile time.

-------------------------When dealing with an API:-----------------------

When dealing with an API that returns a large object with many properties, it's often impractical to define types for every property manually. Here are some strategies to handle this scenario:

1. Partial Types:
Define types for only the properties you need. This approach keeps your type definitions manageable and focused.

2. Utility Types:
Use TypeScript utility types like Pick or Omit to create types based on existing ones but with only the properties you need.

3. Index Signatures:
Use index signatures to represent objects with dynamic or unknown keys.

4. Third-Party Libraries:
Use libraries like zod or io-ts to define and validate the shape of the data at runtime.

--------------------------------- ALSO! ------------------------------------

API developers sometimes provide types or schemas to help consumers use the API correctly and efficiently. Here are some common ways they might do this:

1. TypeScript Type Definitions
Some APIs, especially those designed with TypeScript in mind, provide official type definitions. These definitions can be included directly in the API's SDK or as separate packages.

Example:
SDKs: Libraries provided by API developers often come with TypeScript type definitions.
DefinitelyTyped: Many popular JavaScript libraries have type definitions available via the @types package on npm.
2. OpenAPI/Swagger
APIs may include an OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification, which is a standard format for describing REST APIs. Tools can then generate TypeScript types from these specifications.

Example:
Swagger Codegen: Generates client libraries, server stubs, API documentation, and TypeScript types.
OpenAPI Generator: Another tool for generating TypeScript types and other code from OpenAPI specs.
3. GraphQL
GraphQL APIs include a schema that defines the types and structure of the data. This schema can be used to generate TypeScript types automatically.

Example:
GraphQL Code Generator: A tool to generate TypeScript types and other code from a GraphQL schema.
4. JSON Schema
APIs may provide JSON Schema definitions for their endpoints. These schemas can be converted to TypeScript types.

Example:
json-schema-to-typescript: A tool that converts JSON Schemas to TypeScript types.
5. Manual Definitions
When official type definitions are not provided, developers might create their own types based on API documentation.
