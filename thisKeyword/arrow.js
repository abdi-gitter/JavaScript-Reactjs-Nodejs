/* In JavaScript, an arrow function itself, once defined, is a function 
expression and cannot be "undefined" in the sense that the function 
declaration ceases to exist or the function name points to the 
`undefined` value. However, there are a few scenarios related to 
arrow functions that could lead to confusion or unexpected 
behavior involving `undefined`:



1. **Unassigned Arrow Function**: If you declare an arrow function 
but don't assign it to a variable, you won't be able to reference 
or call the function later. This isn't the same as the function 
being `undefined`, but rather, there's no reference to it.
 */
    
    // This is an arrow function, but it's not assigned to a variable.
    () => console.log("Hello, World!");
    

//Variable Not Assigned**: If you plan to assign an arrow function 
//to a variable, but the assignment hasn't occurred due to 
//some conditional logic or the script hasn't reached that 
//point, the variable could be `undefined`.

   
    let myFunction;
    // At this point, myFunction is undefined.
    // Later in the code, it might be conditionally assigned.
    if (condition) {
        myFunction = () => console.log("Hello, World!");
    }
    // If the condition is false, myFunction remains undefined.



//Return Value**: An arrow function without a body (using the concise body syntax) 
//returns the result of the expression following the arrow. 
//If the expression evaluates to `undefined`, that's the return 
//value of the function. For arrow functions with a body 
//(using curly braces `{}`), you must explicitly return a value; otherwise, 
//the function returns `undefined`.

    
    const returnUndefined = () => {};
    console.log(returnUndefined()); // Logs "undefined" because there's no return statement.




//Destructuring with No Matching Properties**: When using destructuring 
//in arrow function parameters, if the passed object doesn't 
//contain the expected properties, the variables could be `undefined`.

  
    const greet = ({ name }) => console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    greet({}); // Logs "Hello, undefined!" because there's no name property in the passed object.
   

//In summary, while the arrow function itself, once defined, 
//is not `undefined`, there are situations related to referencing, 
//assigning, and the return values of arrow functions that might 
//result in `undefined` behavior or values.
