/* 

The CSS `@import` rule you've shared is used to include the Roboto font family from Google Fonts 
into a CSS file. This font family is specified with weights of 400 (normal weight) and 700 
(bold weight). Here's a breakdown of what this import does and how it can be used:

- `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap');`: 
This line tells the browser to fetch and include the specified CSS file from Google's font service. 
The URL points to the Google Fonts API, requesting the Roboto font family with the specified 
font weights.

- `family=Roboto`: This part of the URL specifies that you're requesting the Roboto font family.

- `wght@400;700`: This specifies the font weights you want to include. `400` corresponds 
to the normal or regular font weight, and `700` corresponds to the bold font weight. 
Including both allows you to use these font weights in your CSS by referring to the 
Roboto font family.

- `display=swap`: This parameter controls font display behavior. Using `swap` 
tells the browser to use a fallback font to display the text until the requested 
font is downloaded. This can improve the perceived load time of web pages by 
ensuring that text is visible sooner, even if it initially appears in a different font.

To use Roboto in your HTML elements, you would then apply it in your CSS like so:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```

This CSS rule sets the Roboto font as the default font for all text inside 
the `<body>` element. If Roboto is not available for some reason, the browser
 will fall back to using any available sans-serif font. Including the font this 
 way enhances the visual design of your web pages by leveraging a high-quality, 
 web-optimized font.

/* 
The CSS code snippet you've shared defines a ::before pseudo-element for the <body> element. 
This pseudo-element is used to insert content just before the content of the <body> tag. 
Here's a detailed breakdown of what each property in the snippet does:

content: ''; This property is required for ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to work. 
It specifies what content to insert. In this case, an empty string is used, meaning no 
actual content is added, but the pseudo-element can still be styled and take up space.
